# 👋 Hi, I'm Nguyen Phuoc Hai!

🎓 I'm a final-year Electronic and Electrical Engineering student at **Ho Chi Minh University of Technology**, passionate about digital design, RTL development, and computer architecture.  
💡 I specialize in **Verilog/SystemVerilog** and **RISC-V architecture**.

## 🚀 Current Project
🧮 **Capstone Project:** *Calculator on FPGA using RISC-V IF Extension*  
A custom pipelined RISC-V processor with:
- 2-bit branch prediction
- Floating-point support (F extension)
- CLA adder, Vedic multiplier, Newton-Raphson divider
- Calculator functions: `+`, `-`, `/`, `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `sqrt`
- Implemented on DE2 FPGA kit

## 🛠️ Skills
- 💻 RTL Design (Verilog, SystemVerilog)
- 🧠 Computer Architecture (RISC-V, Pipelining, Branch Prediction)
- 🧪 Verification (Testbenches, Simulation)
- 🧰 Tools: ModelSim, Quartus, Git
